- **central processing unit** *(CPU)* - Brain of the computer. The faster the CPU the faster the computer. [^1]
- **main memory** *(random access memory, RAM)* - Directly connected to the CPU. All programs must be loaded into main
  memory before they can be executed. [^1]
- **memory cells** - This is what main memory is made up of. They are in an ordered sequence. [^1]
- **address** - A cells unique location in main memory.
- **secondary storage** - The location in which the device stores information permanently. [^1]
- **input device** - Device that feeds data and programs into a computer. [^1]
- **output device** - Device that the computer uses to display results. [^1]
- **System programs** - Programs that control the computer.
- **operating system** - Monitors the overall activity of the computer and provides services.
- **analog signal** - Continuous wave forms used to represent information.
- **digital signal** - Represent information in sequence of 1s and 0s.
- **machine language** - Digital signal being processed inside a computer. The language of a computer. Sequences of 1s
  and 0s.
- **binary digit** *(bit)* - 1 or 0.
- **binary code** *(binary number)* - Sequence of 1s and 0s. [^2]
- **Bit** - A binary digit of 1 or 0. [^2]
- **byte** - A sequence of eight bits. [^2]
- **American Standard Code for Information Interchange** *(ASCII)* - Most commonly used seven-bit encoding scheme. Data
  set consists of 128 characters number 0 through 127.
- **decimal system** *(base 10)* - Number system that we use in our daily lives.
- **binary** *(base 2)* - Number system that computers use.
- **mnemonic** - An instruction in assembly with an easy to remember form. [^3]
- **assembler** - A program that translates assembly into an equivalent program in machine language.
- **high-level languages** - Programming language that is closer to natural language.
- **compiler** - Translates instructions written in high-level languages into equivalent machine language. [^4] [^5]
- **source code** *(source program)* - A program written in a high level language. [^4]
- **preprocessor directives** - Statements that begin with #. 
- **preprocessor** - A program that processes preprocessor directives. [^4] [^5]
- **object program** - The machine language version of the high-level language program.
- **integrated development environment** *(IDE)* - Program needed for writing programs that use a high-level language. 
- **library** - Prewritten code (program) that contains useful code for what you are trying to achieve. [^4] [^5]
- **linker** - A program that combines the object program with programs from libraries. [^4] [^5]
- **loader** - A program that loads an executable program into main memory. [^4] [^5]
- **algorithm** - A step-by-step problem-solving process in which a solution is arrived at in a finite amount of time. [^5]
- **structured design** - Dividing a problem into smaller subproblems.
- **structured programming** - A program that implements structured design.
- **top-down design** - *See structured design*.
- **bottom-up design** - *See structured design*.
- **stepwise refinement** - *See structured design*
- **modular programming** - *See structured design*.
- **object-oriented design** *(OOD)* - Collection of objects interacting with each other.
- **object-oriented programmng** *(OOP)* - A program that implements OOD.
